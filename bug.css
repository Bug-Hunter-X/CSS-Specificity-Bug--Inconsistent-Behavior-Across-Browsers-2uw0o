The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers because of the specificity of the selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `div p` selector is more specific than the `p` selector, so the first rule will take precedence. However, some browsers may handle this differently, leading to inconsistent results.  This is particularly true if there are multiple nested divs or other complex selectors involved.
