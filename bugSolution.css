To avoid this issue, use more precise selectors or utilize the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged for maintainability reasons):

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important; /*Generally not recommended for maintainability*/
}

/* A better solution is to be more precise about which elements to style*/
.specific-paragraph {
  color: red;
}
```

The `!important` flag forces the rule to take precedence, but it's often better to restructure the CSS to avoid such conflicts. The ideal solution would be to add a class to the paragraph element that needs the red color. This ensures better control and predictability without relying on the `!important` declaration.
