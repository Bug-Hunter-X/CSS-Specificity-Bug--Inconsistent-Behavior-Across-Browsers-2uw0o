# CSS Specificity Bug: Cross-Browser Inconsistencies

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to selector specificity.  The problem arises from the way browsers interpret and apply cascading stylesheets when faced with overlapping or conflicting selectors.  More specific selectors, those that are more targeted in their application, will override less specific selectors, but the precise interpretation of 'specificity' can vary slightly across different browsers.

This can lead to unexpected visual differences in the rendering of web pages across different browser environments, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.  The example CSS provided showcases a situation where the outcome isn't universally consistent.

The solution provided offers a more robust and consistent approach to achieve the desired styling, reducing the likelihood of rendering discrepancies across different browsers.
